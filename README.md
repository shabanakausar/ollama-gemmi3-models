## ----------------Enhanced Q&A Chatbot With Gemma3:1b, Gemma3:4b----------------------------------
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# It uses 'Ollama' class of langchain community to generate response to the user query. 
# The user can select the Ollama model from the sidebar and adjust the response parameters
# like temperature and max tokens. The user can ask any question and get the response from 
# the chatbot. The response is generated using the 'generate_response' function which takes
# the user query, Ollama model, temperature, and max tokens as input and returns the response. 
# The response is displayed on the screen. If the user has not entered any question or Ollama 
# API key, it displays a message to enter the question or API key in the settings. The user can
# also enter the Ollama API key in the settings to get the response from the chatbot. The chatbot
#  uses Gemma3:1b and Gemma3:4b models to generate the response to the user query.
